        <h3 class="text-start mb-4">Project Description :</h3>
        <p class="just p-0 m-0">Silbakes is a charming local bakery based in Kochi, renowned for crafting freshly baked,
            customized cakes tailored to suit a variety of special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and other
            celebratory events. The bakery, run by my friend’s mother, focuses on delivering a personalized touch to
            every order, creating cakes that align perfectly with the unique preferences and needs of its customers.

            As part of this project, I developed a user-friendly website for Silbakes, designed to serve as an engaging
            online platform that showcases their exquisite cake offerings. The website features a clean, visually
            appealing layout that highlights the bakery’s craftsmanship through high-quality images and detailed
            descriptions of their products.

            The primary purpose of the website is to connect with local customers in the Kochi area, enabling them to
            explore the variety of cake designs and flavors available, request custom orders, and easily contact the
            bakery for inquiries. While Silbakes does not offer home delivery, the website facilitates a seamless
            ordering process, ensuring that customers can conveniently communicate their specific requirements for
            pickup at the bakery.</p>
            <p class="just">
                This project holds special significance for me as it was a collaboration with a close friend to help bring
            his mother’s baking business into the digital space, making her delightful creations more accessible to
            the community. By focusing on both aesthetics and functionality, the website not only enhances the bakery's
            online presence but also provides a delightful experience for cake lovers in the region.lbakes is a local
            bakery based in Kochi, specializing in freshly baked, custom cakes for
            various occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and special events. The website I created for Silbakes serves
            as an online showcase of their delicious cake offerings, providing an intuitive and visually appealing
            platform for customers in the Kochi area to explore their products, place orders, and get in touch with the
            bakery.
